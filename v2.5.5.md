These will be placed in ./node_modules relative to your package.json file (it's actually slightly more complex than this, so check [the npm docs here](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/folders#more-information)).

> You are free to move the node_modules dir to the parent dir of your app if you want, because node's 'require' mechanism understands this. However, if you want to update your app's dependencies with install/update, npm will not see the relocated 'node_modules' and will instead create a new dir, again relative to package.json.

[About "*.d.ts" in TypeScript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21247278/about-d-ts-in-typescript)

`d` stands for [Declaration Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript#Declaration_files):

> When a TypeScript script gets compiled there is an option to generate a declaration file (with the extension .d.ts) that functions as **an interface to the components in the compiled JavaScript**. In the process the compiler strips away all function and method bodies and preserves only the signatures of the types that are exported. The resulting declaration file can then be used to describe the **exported virtual TypeScript types of a JavaScript library** or module when a third-party developer consumes it from TypeScript.
>
> The concept of declaration files is analogous to the concept of header file found in C/C++.
